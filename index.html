	<h2>Our Church</h2>
<p>Thank you so much for visiting and I pray that you will be blessed by your experience here.  Our mission is to continue to inspire, nurture and demonstrate spiritual principles based on the practical application of the teachings of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>It is always a special time in the Lord. We are excited about what He is doing in our ministry and excited about what He can do in your life!  Isaiah 55:6 “Seek the Lord while he may be found…”
At New Birth, there are many ministries from Teens to TurkeyTuesdays, Women of Destiny to Men of Purpose, Couples to Singles.  We have over 30 ministries to help find a place for you in God so that you can exercise the gift that God has given you.</p>

<p>Worship Service is each Sunday at 10:45 AM and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM.  If you would be our very special guest, I will assure you that you can “Come as you are and Leave Better.”</p>

<p>Carlos D. Coleman</p>
