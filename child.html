<p align="center">What is Children's Worship?
New Birth Outreach Church Children's Ministry is a child-centered ministry focused on studying and sharing God's word, promoting spiritual growth opportunities and glorifying his name.  Children's Ministry provides age-appropriate biblical lessons and fellowship opportunities for children as young as Infancy â€“ 6th grade.

Children's Ministry provides a safe learning environment for children to be nurtured, Holy Spirit inspired, empowered and equipped to become disciples for Jesus Christ. Each Sunday, your child will learn that God made them, God loves them and he will never leave or forsake them!
 
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. ...Proverbs 22:6 KJV

The Children Ministry of New Birth Outreach Church believe in teaching God's word!</p>
