<p align="center">Pastor Carlos D. Coleman is married to Monica Y. Coleman. God has blessed their marriage for eighteen plus years. They have three children (Bryce 18, Isabelle 15, and Noah 10).  Pastor Carlos cherishes his family and the time they are blessed to spend together.</p>

<p align="center">Pastor Carlos earned a Business of Administration degree in Marketing from Columbus State University. He started his career at the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer where he worked in circulation and then later in advertising. In 2002, he left the newspaper to begin his financial practice,The Coleman Capital Group for the next six years.  After closing that office Pastor Carlos went to serve as the CFO of Soto Industries LLC where he helped improve the organizational structure and facilitate the buyout of his father's business partner of 15 years.</p>

<p align="center">As a member of Central Baptist Church, Pastor Carlos was ordained as a deacon in 1999. A year later he accepted his call into the gospel ministry in May of 2000. He was ordained at New Birth Outreach Church in 2003. During his early years in the ministry, Pastor Carlos served as the Youth Pastor at our Norris Rd. sanctuary. From 2008 to September 2014, he served as Pastor of Administration for our Founding Pastor.  Pastor Carlos has had the privilege of serving not only his heavenly father but also his earthly father, Farnsworth Coleman Sr. After eighteen years of committed and loyal service under the leadership of our Founding pastor, Farnsworth Coleman Sr., Pastor Carlos has been elevated as New Birth Outreach Church's Senior Pastor. He will continue to serve God's people with compassion, loyalty and most importantly dedication. He will be the pastor that God said he will give to us in Jeremiah 3:15, "And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding".</p>

<p align="center">Pastor Carlos will continue to "win the lost at any cost". He will continue to build the vision that God has given New Birth as well as layout new visions. He knows that there is much work to be done and he is busy about his Father's work. God has sent us a warrior who will fight for His righteousness by teaching the pure word of God. He will serve with excitement and anticipation to what God has in store for all of us, and most importantly, he will love God's people. We thank God for whom He has sent and we honor our man of God.</p>
